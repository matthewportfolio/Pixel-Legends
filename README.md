Pixel Legends

This is the project I'm currently working on, so please excuse the partly unfinished state. It's an RPG with turn based combat.  with skills, effects, enemies and "Legends" which are completely scalable and modularised. I plan to learn Docker and containerize this so I can host it effortlessly wherever needed.

Technologies used: 
PostgreSQL
Node
